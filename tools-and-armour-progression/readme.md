# Tools & Armour Progression [![License MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/NicholasDJM/mc-datapacks)](https://github.com/NicholasDJM/mc-datapacks/blob/8d6cad4f14c42a0ea76993cb2a8a7d84a37e2e82/LICENSE) ![For Minecraft Java 1.18, 1.17, 1.16](https://img.shields.io/badge/Minecraft%20Java-1.1.8%2C%201.17%2C%201.16-informational)
Removes the crafting recipes for tools and armour except for leather armour and wood tools, and adds smithing recipes for each tier, requiring you to obtain all materials in each tier to get them. The Turtle helmet is unaffected.

For example, to get a Netherite pickaxe, you must first craft a Wooden pickaxe, then upgrade it to stone, then to iron, gold, diamond, and finally, upgrade it to Netherite. (You may, of course, still find pickaxes in chests, like in villages.)

For iron armour, you must also upgrade to chainmail armour first. To get chainmail armour, upgrade an leather armour piece with an iron nugget.

![WARNING:](https://img.shields.io/badge/-WARNING-important) Adding this datapack to your game means you will not be able to upgrade your items unless you find either a smithing table in a village, or some iron ingots!

Thank you to https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca/ for such an awesome tool.

## Installation
This datapack is for Minecraft Java Edition 1.18.1 and above, and has been tested on 1.18.2. This should work on 1.17, and 1.16 as well.

This will not work on versions below 1.16, as it requires the Smithing Table.
Datapacks are not usable on Minecraft Bedrock Edition.
